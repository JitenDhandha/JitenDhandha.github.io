In contrast, JWST's NIRCam reaches 5 um. Among the JWST ERO targets there is a nearby galaxy cluster SMACS 0723-73, which is a massive cluster and has been long recognized as a potential \"cosmic telescope\" in amplifying background galaxies. The ERO six-band NIRCam observations on this target have covered an additional flanking field not boosted by gravitational lensing, which also sees far beyond HST. Here we report the result from our search of candidate objects at z > 11 using these ERO data. In total, there are 87 such objects identified by using the standard \"dropout\" technique. These objects are all detected in multiple bands and therefore cannot be spurious. For most of them, their multi-band colors are inconsistent with known types of contaminants. If the detected dropout signature is interpreted as the expected Lyman-break, it implies that these objects are at z ~ 11--20.

Due to the (redshifted) break produced by neutral hydrogen absorption of rest-frame UV photons, these sources are expected to drop out in the bluer filters while being well detected in redder filters. However, here we show that dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies at lower redshifts (z<7) may also mimic the near-infrared (near-IR) colors of z>10 LBGs, representing potential contaminants in LBG candidate samples. First, we analyze CEERS-DSFG-1, a NIRCam dropout undetected in the F115W and F150W filters but detected at longer wavelengths. Combining the JWST data with (sub)millimeter constraints, including deep NOEMA interferometric observations, we show that this source is a dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at z~5.1. We also present a tentative 2.6sigma SCUBA-2 detection at 850um around a recently identified z~16 LBG candidate in the same field and show that, if the emission is real and associated with this candidate, the available photometry is consistent with a z~5 dusty galaxy with strong nebular emission lines despite its blue near-IR colors. Further observations on this candidate are imperative to mitigate the low confidence of this tentative submillimeter emission and its positional uncertainty. Our analysis shows that robust (sub)millimeter detections of NIRCam dropout galaxies likely imply z=4-6 redshift solutions, where the observed near-IR break would be the result of a strong rest-frame optical Balmer break combined with high dust attenuation and strong nebular line emission, rather than the rest-frame UV Lyman break.

Such parameters are related to intrinsic galaxy properties such as metallicity, star formation rate, and stellar age. Due to the lack of observational constraints at high redshift, dust empirical curves measured in the local Universe (e.g. Calzetti and SMC curves) have been employed to describe the dust attenuation at early epochs. We exploit the high sensitivity and spectral resolution of the JWST to constrain the dust attenuation curves in high-z galaxies. Our goals are to check whether dust attenuation curves evolve with redshift and quantify the dependence of the inferred galaxy properties on the assumed dust attenuation law. We develop a modified version of the SED fitting code BAGPIPES by including a detailed dust attenuation curve parametrization. Dust parameters are derived, along with galaxy properties, from the fit to the data from FUV to mm bands. Once applied to three star-forming galaxies at z = 7-8, we find that their attenuation curves differ from local templates. One out of three galaxies shows a characteristic MW bump, typically associated to the presence of small carbonaceous dust grains such as PAHs. This is one of the first evidences suggesting the presence of PAHs in early galaxies. Galaxy properties such as stellar mass and SFR inferred from SED fitting are strongly affected by the assumed attenuation curve, though the adopted star formation history also plays a major role. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the potential diversity of dust attenuation laws when analyzing the properties of galaxies at the EoR, whose dust properties are still poorly understood.

The depth and wavelength coverage of the JWST data allow us, for the first time, to derive robust stellar masses for such high-z, low stellar-mass galaxies on an individual basis. We compute the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), after complementing our sample with ancillary data from CANDELS to constrain the GMSF at high stellar masses (M > M*). Our results show a steepening of the low stellar-mass end slope (a) with redshift, with a = -1.61 (+/-0.05) at z~4 and a = -1.98 (+/-0.14) at z~7. We also observe an evolution of the normalization phi* from z~7 to z~4, with phi*(z~4)/phi*(z~7)= 130 (+210/-50). Our study incorporates a novel method for the estimation of the Eddington bias that takes into account its possible dependence both on stellar mass and redshift, while allowing for skewness in the error distribution.
