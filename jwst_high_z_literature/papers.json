All are young with mass-weighted ages < 100 Myr, low dust\ncontent $A_V$ < 0.15 mag, and high specific star formation rates sSFR ~10-50\nGyr$^{-1}$ for most. One z ~ 9 candidate is consistent with an age < 5 Myr and\na sSFR ~250 Gyr$^{-1}$, as inferred from a strong F444W excess, implying\n[OIII]+H-beta rest-frame equivalent width ~2000 Angstrom, although an older and\nredder z~ 10 object is also allowed.

For this subset, we find that the key distinctive feature is\ntheir compact size (for massive systems with $\\log (M_{*}/M_{\\odot}) > 10$),\nexhibiting 30% smaller effective radius than the average SFGs at the same\nstellar mass and redshift.

For reionization era galaxies, a neutral intergalactic medium\n(IGM) will scatter Ly-alpha from the line of sight, making Ly-alpha a useful\nprobe of the neutral fraction at z>6. Here, we explore Ly-alpha in JWST/NIRSpec\nspectra from the ongoing GTO program JADES, which targets hundreds of galaxies\nin the well-studied GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. These sources are UV-faint\n(-20.4<MUV<-16.4), and thus represent a poorly-explored class of galaxies. The\nlow spectral resolution (R~100) spectra of a subset of 93 galaxies in GOODS-S\nwith z_spec>5.5 (as derived with optical lines) are fit with line and continuum\nmodels, in order to search for significant line emission. Through exploration\nof the R100 data, we find evidence for Ly-alpha in 15 sources. Additional\nanalysis of the R1000 data from the same set of galaxies results in five\nadditional detections. This sample allows us to place observational constraints\non the fraction of galaxies with Ly-alpha emission in the redshift range\n5.5<z<7.5, with a decrease from z=6 to z=7. We also find a positive correlation\nbetween Ly-alpha equivalent width and MUV, as seen in other samples. These\nresults are used to estimate the neutral gas fraction at z~7, agreeing with\nprevious results (XHI~0.5-0.9).\n"}, {"arxiv_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03120", "fields": ["JADES"], "title": "JADES: Detecting [OIII]$\\lambda 4363$ Emitters and Testing Strong Line Calibrations in the High-$z$ Universe with Ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec Spectroscopy up to $z \\sim 9.5$", "authors": ["Laseter, Isaac H.", "Maseda, Michael V.", "Curti, Mirko", "Maiolino, Roberto", "D'Eugenio, Francesco", "Cameron, Alex J.", "Looser, Tobias J.", "Arribas, Santiago", "Baker, William M.", "Bhatawdekar, Rachana", "Boyett, Kristan", "Bunker, Andrew J.", "Carniani, Stefano", "Charlot, Stephane", "Chevallard, Jacopo", "Curtis-lake, Emma", "Egami, Eiichi", "Eisenstein, Daniel J.", "Hainline, Kevin", "Hausen, Ryan", "Ji, Zhiyuan", "Kumari, Nimisha", "Perna, Michele", "Rawle, Tim", "Rix, Hans-Walter", "Robertson, Brant", "Del Pino, Bruno Rodr\u00edguez", "Sandles, Lester", "Scholtz, Jan", "Smit, Renske", "Tacchella, Sandro", "\u00dcbler, Hannah", "Williams, Christina C.", "Willott, Chris", "Witstok, Joris"], "date": "2023/06/05", "abs": " We present 10 novel [OIII]$\\lambda 4363$ auroral line detections up to $z\\sim\n9.5$ measured from ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy from the JWST\nAdvanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES).

We\ncompare C/O and N/O of these 3 galaxies with those of theoretical models, and\nfind that these 3 galaxies are explained by scenarios with dominant CNO-cycle\nmaterials, i.e. Wolf-Rayet stars, supermassive ($10^{3}-10^{5}\\ M_{\\odot}$)\nstars, and tidal disruption events, interestingly with a requirement of\nfrequent direct collapses. For all the 70 galaxies, we present measurements of\nNe/O, S/O, and Ar/O, together with C/O and N/O. We identify 4 galaxies with\nvery low Ne/O, $\\log(\\rm Ne/O)<-1.0$, indicating abundant massive ($\\gtrsim30\\\nM_\\odot$) stars.\n"}, {"arxiv_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17225", "fields": ["CEERS"], "title": "A Robust Study of High-Redshift Galaxies: Unsupervised Machine Learning for Characterising morphology with JWST up to z ~ 8", "authors": ["Tohill, Cl\u00e1r-Br\u00edd", "Bamford, Steven", "Conselice, Christopher", "Ferreira, Leonardo", "Harvey, Thomas", "Adams, Nathan", "Austin, Duncan"], "date": "2023/06/29", "abs": " Galaxy morphologies provide valuable insights into their formation processes,\ntracing the spatial distribution of ongoing star formation and encoding\nsignatures of dynamical interactions. While such information has been\nextensively investigated at low redshift, it is crucial to develop a robust\nsystem for characterising galaxy morphologies at earlier cosmic epochs. Relying\nsolely on the nomenclature established for low-redshift galaxies risks\nintroducing biases that hinder our understanding of this new regime. In this\npaper, we employ variational auto-encoders to perform feature extraction on\ngalaxies at z $>$ 2 using JWST/NIRCam data. Our sample comprises 6869 galaxies\nat z $>$ 2, including 255 galaxies z $>$ 5, which have been detected in both\nthe CANDELS/HST fields and CEERS/JWST, ensuring reliable measurements of\nredshift, mass, and star formation rates. To address potential biases, we\neliminate galaxy orientation and background sources prior to encoding the\ngalaxy features, thereby constructing a physically meaningful feature space. We\nidentify 11 distinct morphological classes that exhibit clear separation in\nvarious structural parameters, such as CAS-$M_{20}$, S\\'ersic indices, specific\nstar formation rates, and axis ratios. We observe a decline in the presence of\nspheroidal-type galaxies with increasing redshift, indicating a dominance of\ndisk-like galaxies in the early universe. We demonstrate that conventional\nvisual classification systems are inadequate for high-redshift morphology\nclassification and advocate the need for a more detailed and refined\nclassification scheme. Leveraging machine-extracted features, we propose a\nsolution to this challenge and illustrate how our extracted clusters align with\nmeasured parameters, offering greater physical relevance compared to\ntraditional methods.\n"}]
