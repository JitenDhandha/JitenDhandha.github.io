Here we report the discovery of 12\ngalaxy candidates observed 300-600 Myr after the Big Bang with photometric\nredshifts between z ~ 8.5-13 measured using JWST NIRCam imaging of the galaxy\ncluster WHL0137 observed in 8 filters spanning 0.8-5.0 $\\mu$m, plus 9 HST\nfilters spanning 0.4-1.7 $\\mu$m. Three of these candidates are gravitationally\nlensed by the foreground galaxy cluster and have magnifications of $\\mu \\sim 3\n- 8$. The remaining nine candidates are located in a second JWST NIRCam module,\ncentered ~29' from the cluster center, with expected magnifications of $\\mu$ <~\n1.1. Our sample of high-redshift candidates have observed F200W AB magnitudes\nbetween 25.9 and 28.1 mag and intrinsic F200W AB magnitudes between 26.4 and\n29.7 mag ($M_{UV}$ = -22.5 to -17). We find the stellar masses of these\ngalaxies are in the range $\\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot}$ = 8 - 9, and down to 7.5 for\nthe lensed galaxies. All are young with mass-weighted ages < 100 Myr, low dust\ncontent $A_V$ < 0.15 mag, and high specific star formation rates sSFR ~10-50\nGyr$^{-1}$ for most. One z ~ 9 candidate is consistent with an age < 5 Myr and\na sSFR ~250 Gyr$^{-1}$, as inferred from a strong F444W excess, implying\n[OIII]+H-beta rest-frame equivalent width ~2000 Angstrom, although an older and\nredder z~ 10 object is also allowed. Another z~9 candidate ID9356 is lensed\ninto an arc 2.6\" long by the effects of strong gravitational lensing ($\\mu$~8),\nand has at least two bright knots of unevenly distributed star formation. This\narc is the most spatially-resolved galaxy at z~9 known to date, revealing\nstructures ~30 pc across. Follow-up spectroscopy of WHL0137 with JWST/NIRSpec\nis planned for later this year, which will validate some of these candidates\nand study their physical properties in more detail.\n"}, {"arxiv_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03896", "fields": ["GLASS", "CEERS", "SMACS J0723.3-7323", "Stephan's Quintet", "ALMA*"], "title": "ALMA FIR View of Ultra High-redshift Galaxy Candidates at $z\\sim$ 11-17: Blue Monsters or Low-$z$ Red Interlopers?", "authors": ["Fujimoto, Seiji", "Finkelstein, Steven L.", "Burgarella, Denis", "Carilli, Chris L.", "Buat, V\u00e9ronique", "Casey, Caitlin M.", "Ciesla, Laure", "Tacchella, Sandro", "Zavala, Jorge A.", "Brammer, Gabriel", "Fudamoto, Yoshinobu", "Ouchi, Masami", "Valentino, Francesco", "Cooper, M.

Due to the (redshifted) break produced by neutral\nhydrogen absorption of rest-frame UV photons, these sources are expected to\ndrop out in the bluer filters while being well detected in redder filters.\nHowever, here we show that dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies at lower\nredshifts (z<7) may also mimic the near-infrared (near-IR) colors of z>10 LBGs,\nrepresenting potential contaminants in LBG candidate samples. First, we analyze\nCEERS-DSFG-1, a NIRCam dropout undetected in the F115W and F150W filters but\ndetected at longer wavelengths. Combining the JWST data with (sub)millimeter\nconstraints, including deep NOEMA interferometric observations, we show that\nthis source is a dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at z~5.1. We also present a\ntentative 2.6sigma SCUBA-2 detection at 850um around a recently identified z~16\nLBG candidate in the same field and show that, if the emission is real and\nassociated with this candidate, the available photometry is consistent with a\nz~5 dusty galaxy with strong nebular emission lines despite its blue near-IR\ncolors.

By combining this sample\nwith more massive galaxies at similar redshifts from other programmes, we study\nthe scaling relations between stellar mass (M*), oxygen abundance (O/H), and\nstar-formation rate (SFR) across three orders of magnitude in mass out to the\nepoch of early galaxy assembly. We find evidence for a shallower slope at the\nlow-mass-end of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), with 12 + log(O/H) = (7.88\n+- 0.03) + (0.17 +- 0.04) log(M*/10^8 M_sun), in good agreement with the MZR\nprobed by local analogues of high-redshift systems like `green pea' and\n`blueberry' galaxies. The inferred slope is well matched by models including\n`momentum-driven' SNe winds, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in dwarf\ngalaxies (and at high-z) might be different from those in place at higher\nmasses. The evolution in the normalisation is instead observed to be relatively\nmild compared to previous determinations of the MZR at z~3 (~0.1-0.2 dex on\naverage). We also find a progressive deviation from the local fundamental\nmetallicity relation (FMR) as a function of redshift, especially at z>6, with\ngalaxies significantly less enriched (by ~0.4 dex on average) than predicted\ngiven their M* and SFR. These observations are consistent with an enhanced\nstochasticity in the accretion rate from the cosmic web, and/or with an\nincreased efficiency in metal removals by outflows, prompting us to reconsider\nthe nature of the relationship between M*, O/H, and SFR in the early Universe.\n"}, {"arxiv_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08517", "fields": ["CEERS"], "title": "JWST CEERS probes the role of stellar mass and morphology in obscuring galaxies", "authors": ["G\u00f3mez-Guijarro, Carlos", "Magnelli, Benjamin", "Elbaz, David", "Wuyts, Stijn", "Daddi, Emanuele", "Bail, Aur\u00e9lien Le", "Giavalisco, Mauro", "Dickinson, Mark", "P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez, Pablo G.", "Haro, Pablo Arrabal", "Bagley, Micaela B.", "Bisigello, Laura", "Buat, V\u00e9ronique", "Burgarella, Denis", "Calabr\u00f2, Antonello", "Casey, Caitlin M.", "Cheng, Yingjie", "Ciesla, Laure", "Dekel, Avishai", "Ferguson, Henry C.", "Finkelstein, Steven L.", "Franco, Maximilien", "Grogin, Norman A.", "Holwerda, Benne W.", "Jin, Shuowen", "Kartaltepe, Jeyhan S.", "Koekemoer, Anton M.", "Kokorev, Vasily", "Long, Arianna S.", "Lucas, Ray A.", "Magdis, Georgios E.", "Papovich, Casey", "Pirzkal, Nor", "Seill\u00e9, Lise-Marie", "Tacchella, Sandro", "Tarrasse, Maxime", "Valentino, Francesco", "de la Vega, Alexander", "Wilkins, Stephen M.", "Xiao, Mengyuan", "Yung, L.

The measured number density of galaxies at $z=8$ and $z=9$ match\nthose of past observations undertaken by the em Hubble Space Telescope (HST).\nHowever, towards higher redshifts we find that the evolution of the UV LF is\nmild, resulting in higher measured number densities of UV luminous galaxies at\n$z=10.5$ and $z=12.5$ compared to predictions from simulations and past HST\nobservations. When examining the star formation rate density of galaxies at\nthis time period, our observations are still consistent with a constant star\nformation efficiency, are slightly lower than previous early estimations using\nJWST and support galaxy driven reionization at $z\\sim8$.\n"}, {"arxiv_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12347", "fields": ["CEERS", "COSMOS-Web", "PRIMER"], "title": "Two massive, compact, and dust-obscured candidate $z\\sim 8$ galaxies discovered by JWST", "authors": ["Akins, Hollis B.", "Casey, Caitlin M.", "Allen, Natalie", "Bagley, Micaela B.", "Dickinson, Mark", "Finkelstein, Steven L.", "Franco, Maximilien", "Harish, Santosh", "Haro, Pablo Arrabal", "Ilbert, Olivier", "Kartaltepe, Jeyhan S.", "Koekemoer, Anton M.", "Liu, Daizhong", "Long, Arianna S.", "McCracken, Henry Joy", "Paquereau, Louise", "Papovich, Casey", "Pirzkal, Nor", "Rhodes, Jason", "Robertson, Brant E.", "Shuntov, Marko", "Toft, Sune", "Yang, Guang", "Barro, Guillermo", "Bisigello, Laura", "Buat, V\u00e9ronique", "Champagne, Jaclyn B.", "Cooper, Olivia", "Costantin, Luca", "de la Vega, Alexander", "Drakos, Nicole E.", "Faisst, Andreas", "Fontana, Adriano", "Fujimoto, Seiji", "Gillman, Steven", "G\u00f3mez-Guijarro, Carlos", "Gozaliasl, Ghassem", "Hathi, Nimish P.", "Hayward, Christopher C.", "Hirschmann, Michaela", "Holwerda, Benne W.", "Jin, Shuowen", "Kocevski, Dale D.", "Kokorev, Vasily", "Lambrides, Erini", "Lucas, Ray A.", "Magdis, Georgios E.", "Magnelli, Benjamin", "McKinney, Jed", "Mobasher, Bahram", "P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez, Pablo G.", "Rich, R.
